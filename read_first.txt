Hardware required:
- Huawei E3372h 4G USB Modem with antennas (and re-flash it to E3372s) - certainly easier to get a s-version straight-away. 
- short USB OTG cable
- SIM card
- Mobile phone with Wi-Fi tethering
- Raspberry Pi 3
- TL-WN723N USB Wi-Fi Module
- Portable USB battery
- recommended, but optional: USB Ethernet Adapter (Apple MC704ZM/A works)

Please see the indvidual Disco_install.txt, RPi3_install.txt, SC2_install.txt

you will not need all binaries/modules provided for SC2/Disco. Some come in handy for debugging and testing.

Disclaimer:
This is still a dirty hack. No clean-up has been done yet.

Major todos:
- add basic error handling
- add reconnect (lte-ppp, and tcptunnel-ppp)
- move variables to single properties file, no hard-coded values in scripts
- add iptables on the disco (currently all ports are open on all interfaces, someone on the same mobile network can telnet into the Disco without password!!! - workaround: killall telnetd && /usr/sbin/telnetd -F -b 192.168.42.1 -l /bin/login.sh &)
- add comments to the scripts and make scripts human readable :)
