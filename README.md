# Parrot Disco over 4G/LTE Demo (softmod)

## About
Disco4G is a software modification (softmod) for the Parrot Disco drone. Instead of the built-in regular Wi-Fi, it allows to use a 4G/LTE cellular/mobile network connection to link Skycontroller 2 to the Disco. Control/telemetry and live video stream are routed through the 4G/LTE connection. In other words, range limit becomes your imagination! Ok, to be fair, it's still limited by the battery ;)

**TODO:** replace youtube video with new one

Pros:
- Range limit is no longer dependent on Wi-Fi signal
- Low hardware cost (around US$ 40.-)
- All stock hardware can be used (standard Parrot Skycontroller 2 with FreeFlight Pro App)
- Return-to-home (RTH) is auto-initiated in case of connection loss
- Allows independent real-time GPS tracking via Glympse <add link>
- Easy initiation of 4G/LTE connection via Skycontroller 2 button
- Can be used for manually controlled flights as well as flight plans

Cons:
- Dependent on [4G/LTE mobile network coverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_4G_LTE_penetration) 
- Might incur mobile data cost (dependent on your mobile network operator)
- Slightly higher latency as compared to Wi-Fi

## Why?
- The Parrot Disco's stock Wi-Fi loses video signal way before the specified 2 km.
- Because we can :)
